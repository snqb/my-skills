## What It Does

Creates museum-quality visual art as PDF or PNG files using a two-step design philosophy approach:
1. **Design Philosophy Creation** - Creates an aesthetic movement/manifesto (like "Brutalist Joy" or "Chromatic Silence")
2. **Visual Expression** - Expresses that philosophy through 90% visual design, 10% essential text

## When to Use

- Creating posters, art prints, or design pieces
- Building visual identities with sophisticated aesthetics
- Generating design artifacts that look hand-crafted by experts
- Making art that embeds subtle conceptual references

## Key Principles

- **Visual-first communication** - Ideas expressed through form, space, color, not paragraphs
- **Master craftsmanship** - Every detail appears labored over by someone at the top of their field
- **Minimal, essential text** - Typography as visual element, not explanation
- **Sophisticated references** - Subtle conceptual threads woven invisibly into composition
- **No AI slop** - Avoid generic, cartoony, or amateur aesthetics

## Design Philosophy Examples

- **Concrete Poetry** - Monumental form, bold geometry, sculptural typography
- **Chromatic Language** - Color as primary information system, geometric precision
- **Analog Meditation** - Quiet contemplation, texture, vast negative space
- **Organic Systems** - Natural clustering, modular growth patterns
- **Geometric Silence** - Pure order, grid precision, dramatic restraint

## Output

- Design philosophy as `.md` file (4-6 paragraphs)
- Visual artwork as `.pdf` or `.png` file
- Multi-page option for coffee table book style spreads
