## What It Does

Guides Claude to create distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces that avoid generic "AI slop" aesthetics. Focuses on bold design choices, creative typography, intentional motion, and memorable visual details.

## When to Use

- Building web components, pages, or full applications
- Creating landing pages or dashboards
- Styling React/Vue/HTML components
- Beautifying existing UIs
- Any web design work that needs to stand out

## Key Principles

1. **Bold aesthetic direction** - Pick a clear conceptual vision and execute it precisely
2. **Distinctive typography** - Avoid generic fonts (Inter, Roboto), use characterful choices
3. **Intentional color** - Dominant colors with sharp accents, cohesive CSS variables
4. **High-impact motion** - Orchestrated page loads, scroll-triggers, surprising interactions
5. **Unexpected layouts** - Asymmetry, overlap, grid-breaking elements
6. **Atmospheric details** - Gradients, textures, patterns that match the aesthetic

## Usage

Simply mention frontend/UI work in your request. Claude will automatically apply these design principles.

Examples:
- "Build a landing page for a brutalist architecture studio"
- "Create a dashboard with a retro-futuristic aesthetic"
- "Design a minimalist portfolio site"

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

❌ Purple gradients on white backgrounds
❌ Generic system fonts
❌ Predictable layouts
❌ Cookie-cutter components
❌ Converging on common choices (Space Grotesk, etc.)
