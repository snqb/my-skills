# my-skills

Personal collection of [pi](https://github.com/mariozechner/pi) agent skills. Not polished — these are working tools I use daily, shared as-is. Some are rough, some are great, all are useful to me.

## Usage

```bash
# Symlink into your pi skills directory
ln -s /path/to/my-skills ~/.pi/agent/skills
```

Each folder contains a `SKILL.md` that pi picks up automatically.
